                            <p>FAQ</p>
                            <p>1. Are you going to charge me for this service?
                            PETA does not charge for the service, but your carrier’s standard messaging charges may apply.</p>
                            <p>2. How do I unsubscribe from receiving text messages?
                            To unsubscribe at any time, simply text the word “STOP” to the short code that you wish to unsubscribe from: 99099 or 73822. Or call 1-866-251-1200.</p>
                            <p>3. Who is Msgme?
                            Msgme is the platform chosen by PETA to deliver text messages and ringtones. It is a service from Waterfall Mobile.</p>
                            <p>4. How do I find the message Msgme has sent?
                            Cell phones vary dramatically on where and how they display SMS/text messages. We regularly test the Msgme service on more than 800 phone models, although some models have variations based on the carrier. Unfortunately, there is no standard set of instructions on how to find text messages on the wide variety of phones.</p>
                            <p>Below are some tips that should help you, however.</p>
                            <p>Typically, there is a menu button on the phone that, when pushed, lists all the available options. Look for an option that says, “SMS,” “Text Messages,” “Messages,” or “Notifications.” This will open up a list of all messages that your phone has received, listed in the order that they were received. Scroll using the arrow keys on your phone until you see a message from the number 99099 or 73822. Once the message is highlighted, press the “OK” or “Go” button or the green button on your phone to open the message.</p>
